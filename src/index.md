  title: "Website Design for Your Small Business"
  description: "My name is Theresa Thomson, and I specialize in small business website design. My ultimate mission is to provide websites for local businesses that are professional, yet affordably priced. As a resident of Roswell, Georgia, I work directly with clients in the Roswell, Alpharetta, and metro Atlanta area. If you are seeking the attention and care that only a local web designer can provide, I will gladly meet with you to discuss a plan that works for you. If you don't live in or around the metro Atlanta area, that's okay too; I also work with non-local clients.

If you are starting a new business, I can help you launch your first website to assist in growing your customer base. If you already have a website, we can talk about ways to improve how it engages your clientele and propagates new business leads."

# Mobile & SEO-Friendly Web Design

Increasingly, people are using mobile phones to search for businesses. As a result, many businesses are opting to make their sites responsive, which allows for easy browsing on smaller devices. Consequently, Google includes mobile-friendliness as a ranking factor for mobile search results. Therefore, it is important to have a responsive website that displays well on all devices, whether on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer. If your website is not already mobile-friendly, I can build you a responsive site that cultivates a positive viewing and search experience.

If you want people to find your business while searching online, having a search-engine-optimized (SEO-friendly) website is highly advised. SEO makes it easy for search engines to understand what your website is about, helping drive more traffic to your site, connecting you with more clients. A solid SEO foundation is an indispensable marketing tool.
